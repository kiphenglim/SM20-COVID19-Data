BEL,Belgium - units unclear,2020-05-18,https://epistat.sciensano.be/Data/COVID19BE_tests.csv,Sciensano (Belgian institute for health),,79,585806,50.546,5853,0.505,13406,1.157,Sciensano (Belgian institute for health),https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/,The data is described both as the number of tests performed and as the number of tested patients.,"Sciensano provides a daily time series of the number of tests conducted per day, which is updated retrospectively as new data becomes available each day.

According to the [dataset codebook](https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf), dates for new testing figures correspond to the date of laboratory diagnosis (or when not available, date of sampling). 

It appears that the reported testing figures represent the number of people tested, but this is not entirely clear. The official website describes the testing dataset as the ""Dataset of total number of tests performed by date"", yet the [dataset codebook](https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf) defines the ""tests"" variable as the ""number of tested patients"".

It is also unclear whether the testing figures include antigen tests in addition to PCR tests. In a communication on April 3rd 2020, Sciensano indicates that antigen tests made by Coris Bioconcept may now be used for COVID-19 detection. The communication states that positive antigen test results do not have to be confirmed by a PCR test, but that negative or doubtful cases must be confirmed by a PCR test.

Official figures reported in Sciensano's daily epidemiological bulletins do not help to clarify these ambiguities. For example, as of May 10th 2020, the [official time series dataset](https://epistat.sciensano.be/covid/covid19_historicaldata.html) reported a cumulative total of 465,201 tests performed between March 1st and May 9th. However, the epidemiological bulletin for [May 10th 2020](https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/COVID-19_Daily%20report_20200510%20-%20FR.pdf) states that 325,796 cumulative tests had been performed by laboratories between the beginning of March and May 9th, while an additional 240,305 tests had been performed through the national testing platform (566,101 total tests).

The bulletin indicates that these figures include both PCR and antigen tests, suggesting that the large discrepancy between the 465,201 figure and the 566,101 figure may be solely due to the fact that the official time series data only includes PCR tests, whereas the official bulletin figures include both PCR and antigen tests. However, it is also possible that the discrepancy is due solely to the fact that the official time series data is reported in terms of ""people tested"", whereas the bulletin figures represent ""tests performed"". We have been unable to find official documentation from Sciensano that resolves these ambiguities."

Under this assumption, we measure the total number of cases tested to date as the sum of the number of confirmed and discarded cases.

Unfortunately, the official dashboard does not provide a time series of the number of cases tested each day since testing began.

More recently, the Ministry of Health has begun reporting figures for the number of PCR and 'rapid tests' on a dashboard on its [Panel of beds and inputs](https://covid-insumos.saude.gov.br/paineis/insumos/painel.php) webpage. However we do not include these figures because they appear to relate to the number of tests distributed, rather than the number of tests performed. This is not made clear from the dashboard itself.

Further descriptions of the testing data are provided [here](https://thl.fi/fi/web/infektiotaudit-ja-rokotukset/ajankohtaista/ajankohtaista-koronaviruksesta-covid-19/tilannekatsaus-koronaviruksesta). In this document it notes that:

- ""Public and private sector laboratories report to THL (health authority) the number of samples tested per hospital district""
- ""The actual number of infections in Finland is probably higher than reported, as not all mild symptoms have been tested so far and no information is available on the number of asymptomatic infections.""
- ""Coronavirus testing is performed in both the public and private sectors in several laboratories.""

The data description notes that tests are being rationed and allocated according to the following strategy: ""Samples are taken primarily from patients with severe symptoms of respiratory infection and from health and social care staff to ensure staff health and labor adequacy....Attention has also been paid to vulnerable groups of patients with some underlying disease and to those over 70 years of age.""

This data series extends to the 27th February, when test figures were very low (9 tests per day). It is likely this is was the first day, or close to the first day of testing."

The latest update with testing figures, as of 16th May, was published on the 7th May. The updates include a figure for the number of tests performed (‘Nombre de tests réalisés’). A breakdown into positive and negative results are given, along with a positive test rate. The most recent epidemiological report, dated 14th May, does not provide the number of laboratory and hospital tests performed.

The figures in the time series relate to tests performed since 24 February. Since the 24 March update, in addition to the previously reported hospital tests, laboratory tests are also reported. Only the total number of laboratory tests performed between 24 February and 24 March is presented, without a time series. Our figure for 24 March adds the cumulative number of laboratory tests since 24 February (6,500) to the hospital tests figure (101,046). As such 24 March represents a break in the series."

Note that the number of laboratories reporting in the data seems to vary from week to week.,"To determine how many laboratory tests regarding SARS-CoV-2 are carried out per calendar week in Germany and how many tests are positive or negative, the RKI has started a Germany-wide laboratory query. However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.

The report published on 13 May states that “from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 19/2020”:
– The cumulative total of samples tested was 3,147,771;
- For calendar week 19 (which ends 10 May), 173 labs reported 382,154 samples tested;
- For calendar week 18 (which ends on 3 May), 174 labs reported 325,259 samples tested;
- For calendar week 17 (which ends on 26 April), 176 labs reported 360,443 samples tested;
- For calendar week 16 (which ends on 19 April), 167 labs reported 330,027 samples tested;
- For calendar week 15 (which ends on 12 April), 163 labs reported 379,233 samples tested;
– For calendar week 14 (which ends on 5 April), 154 labs reported 408,348 samples tested;
– For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 151 labs reported 361,515 samples tested;
– For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 152 labs reported 348,619 samples tested;
– For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127,457 samples tested.
– Up to and including calendar week 10 (which ends on 8 March), 90 labs reported 124,716 samples tested.

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week.

Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, previous figures may be revised upwards slightly in subsequent reports. The source is explicit that these figures refer to tests performed and that this will not equal the number of people tested, because of multiple tests per person."

More recent reports are explicit that the figures relate to samples tested rather than the number of people: The note mentioned that the figures are ""including more than one sample per person tested"" (""συμπεριλαμβάνονται και περισσότερα από ένα δείγματα ανά άτομο που ελέγχθηκε"").

It is not totally explicit whether the figures cover all testing in Greece: the figures are labelled as ""Samples that have been tested in the laboratories cooperating with EODY"" (""Δείγματα που έχουν ελεγχθεί στα συνεργαζόμενα με τον ΕΟΔΥ εργαστήρια"").

Earlier updates listed their figures as 'tests carried out'. Given that there is no visible break in the series, we assume that the figures have always related to the number of people tested and the change in label reflects only a clarification of this.

In the FAQs beneath the figures, the website states that ""Only a test on respiratory secretions is currently available to detect the presence of the new coronavirus."""

The title of the table indicates that these figures relate to cases. As far as we are aware, cases are equivalent to individuals tested.

In a previous version of this page, we reported total tests as the sum of positive, negative, and pending tests. However, since April 7th 2020, the source has not reported the number of pending tests each day. For this reason, we have updated the time series so that total tests is equal to the sum of positive and negative tests (excluding pending tests) for all days on which we report data."

While geographical coverage is complete, there is a time lag in the publication of the data, and recent days systematically show temporary low figures. Data starts on 1 January 2020; we do now know if this is because tests started on that date or because earlier data is not available.

There appear to be reporting lags, such that the number of labs reporting for days in the current week tend to be lower than for the previous week. As a result, the reported figures are updated retrospectively as additional labs report their results. The figures we display are based on the latest available epidemiological report.

The epidemiological reports state that 'all laboratories in the Netherlands that perform diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 have been asked from 9 March to report these data daily.' However, the number of labs reporting in a given weekly figure has varied over the course of the reports, which may affect the consistency of the time series we present."

This information includes demographic information of confirmed cases.

These daily reports state the cumulative number of people who have been tested – including the number and share who tested positive. We can use these daily updates to construct a full time-series. Note that the source states that ""Data for the last few days is incomplete and will be updated in upcoming daily reports"", that the ""Number of tested and proportion of positive findings among the tested is affected by changes in test criteria"". It also notes that ""Laboratory data is now retrieved from the new national laboratory database, which gives us [a] more complete data set with regard to sampling date"". Earlier reports noted that ""The figure contains only numbers from laboratories that have reports that include the sampling date"" [all via Google Translate]. As such, this seems to imply an increase in coverage across laboratories over time.

In addition to the aggregate number of people tested, the source provides a regional breakdown, in which it is noted that tests in 'private labs that analyze tests across the country' are excluded. The sum of this breakdown is lower than the aggregate figure provided. We take this as an indication that the main aggregate figure we report includes all private testing.

Daily reports with figures on testing are only available dating back to 16th March. We therefore do not know the first date of testing, only that as of 16th March, 18062 people had been tested.

The time of day to which the testing figures relate appears to have changed. Earlier daily reports refers to those tested up until 3pm (local time) of the previous day. More recent reports relate to those tested up until midnight (local time) of the previous day."

The reported figures include the total number of positive, negative, and ""positive control"" test results to date.

It is unclear whether the total number of tests performed (""pruebas realizadas"") refers to the number of people tested or the number of samples tested. The number of reported positive test results is equal to the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, which suggests that the number of tests performed is equivalent to the number of people tested. However, because the data source does not provide a clear definition, we record the units as ""unclear"".

Unfortunately, the Ministry of Health's official dashboard does not provide a time series of the number of tests performed each day since testing began. Instead, the dashboard only displays a daily snapshot of the total number of tests performed to date.

It is possible that the figures are equivalent to the number of people tested, since the number of positive samples reported tend to be equal to the daily number of confirmed cases that the ministry reports.

Using web archives, we construct a daily time series of total samples by looking at earlier snapshots of the website. These archives begin from the 15th March. We are unable to determine when testing began, only that on the 15th March a total of 1545 tests had been conducted. Earlier archives make it clear that the figures relate to the sum of positive and negative tests (i.e. tests pending results are not included).

We found the total number of negative and positive samples was identical for the 26/03 and 27/03. The reason for this is not clear. We include only the former date as an observation. From the 29/03 - 01/04 and  05/04 - 07/04 no web archives could be retreived.

From the 14th April, we became aware of a [short term dashboard](https://covid-19.nczisk.sk/en/) by the National Centre of Health and Information providing the same figures over the last 6 days. We have used this source to supplement testing data for the 10th April where web archives were not available. The notes to this dashboard provide further elaboration.

The NICD reports the number of 'tests conducted' in addition to the number of 'positive cases' (and sometimes the number of 'negative cases').

ESP,Spain - tests performed,2020-05-14,https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/COVID-19_pruebas_diagnosticas_14_05_2020.pdf,"Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare",,5,1919411,41.053,,,42029,0.899,"Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social",https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do,The number of tests performed.,"Official data covering the whole of Spain was only published sporadically until the end of April 2020.

The first estimate in our time series comes from a Ministry of Health press release, quoting Salvador Illa, Minister of Health: ""From the beginning of the crisis and until April 13, the total number of PCR carried out in Spain is 930,230."" The press release is [here](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=detalle&id=4864).

The second is another Ministry of Health press release published on 27 April and relating to testing conducted up to 23 April. It provides a breakdown across Autonomous Communities (regions), with a total for Spain of 1,035,522 PCR tests. The same release provides a figure of 310,038 antibody tests conducted nationwide. These are different to the PCR tests, as we discuss [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19). Our database aims to not include antibody tests. So in order to provide the data that is most comparable to the other countries in our database, we include only the PCR tests count for this observation.

One aspect of the 27 April press release that is not totally clear is whether the figures provided for each Autonomous Community relate to the 23 April. Comparing the regional breakdowns provided in the Ministry of Health release to those collected from official sources by CIVIO (as of 28 April) suggests that the figure of 203,892 provided for Madrid in the Ministry of Health update—ostensibly dating to the 23 April—may date back to 14 April.

Further data points are collected from the [Ministry of Health's press releases](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=verHistorico) or [its Twitter account](https://twitter.com/sanidadgob).

[CIVIO](https://datos.civio.es/dataset/pcr-coronavirus-covid19-espana-comunidades-autonomas/) is a non-profit investigative data journalism organisation who are collating information on tests performed within each Autonomous Community, as released through official channels (communication offices, web pages, press releases and social networks of the different regions). We do not report these figures because their data are not complete: For some autonomous communities, figures are available only irregular intervals. The figures they provide are broadly in-line with those of the Ministry of Health releases, although with somewhat lower figures for some Autonomous Communities. This may be due to the Ministry of Health having access to more recent estimates for these Autonomous Communities."

A note is provided at the same website indicating that the testing strategy has changed over time: ""Initially, people who were living in areas with known spread of covid-19 were sampled. But since mid-March, people with symptoms consistent with covid-19 infection who are in need of inpatient hospital care, healthcare personnel and elderly care, and people who are being tested in sentinel testing are primarily being tested.

It is not clear whether this represents the total number of tests performed, or the number of people tested. The number 'tested' is greater than the sum of confirmed cases and 'excluded' (i.e. negative) test results. This would suggest it does not equal the total number of people tested, or if it does, pending results without a reported outcome are also included.

Although the CDC only show the last day's figures on this dashboard, we can construct a time-series by looking at previous versions on web archive. Where possible we have tried to take the total test counts at the same time every day (those published at 00:30h). Unfortunately this time of publishing from CDC was not always completely consistent. This may lead to small discrepancies between 'total tested' and 'new from 'yesterday' figures. Wherever possible we took the total test count as of 00:30 as the prefered figure; where a day of data was missing we used the 'new from yesterday' figure to calculate the total for the previous day. If there are small discrepancies with other sources, this timing issue is likely to be the cause. In any case it is likely to be minor.

The date from which the total test figures date back to is not known; the CDC dashboard is unavailable in web archives prior to 21st March."

PUI is the sum of confirmed cases, the number of people who tested negative, and the number of people for whom results are still pending. All three figures are reported individually from 3rd March until 31st March. From 1st April onwards, the number of people who tested negative and the number for whom results are still pending are no longer reported separately.

We have received communication from Thailand's Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) that individuals who did not meet PUI criteria can pay out of pocket to have their samples tested, referred to as the ""non-PUI"" group. This ""non-PUI"" group is large in the context of Thailand. This ""non-PUI"" group is not reflected in our current figures.

It is unclear whether the difference between the numbers relates to a genuine distinction in the two figures between the number of indivudals tested and the number of tests performed, or if the differences are due instead to reporting delays or other unintended discrepancies.

After the 14th April, press releases by the Office of the Director General publishes the daily number of samples tested. We sum the cumulative total number of samples tested for the previous day with the daily number of samples tested today. For example, the total number of samples tested on the 15th April is equal to the cumulative total up until the 14th April plus the number of samples tested on the 15th April. 

For the 18th April, we rely on the figure reported by the MOH official twitter account to calculate our cumulative totals. From the 5th May, we rely on the figures reported by the MOH official twitter account and check figures against press releases where they have been made available by the MOH.  

We are aware of Uganda's [MOH information portal](https://covid19.gou.go.ug/), however, it only lists the 'cumulative # tested' without specifying more precise units of measurement. Our cumulative totals for the number of samples tested from 19/04 matches the 'cumulative # tested' total in the Uganda information portal for 20/04. This suggests the 'cumulative # tested' refers to the samples tested up until the previous day.

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.

The Project documents their work in lots of detail. See the link provided above for full details."
USA,United States - tests performed,2020-05-19,https://web.archive.org/web/20200520183014/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html,United States CDC,,5,12601143,38.07,1318362,3.983,410895,1.241,United States CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html,The number of tests performed.,"On 13 May 2020, the United States CDC's viral testing data was modified to include viral tests performed by commercial, hospital, public health, and CDC laboratories. This new data is available on the [Viral Testing Data in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html) page and [CDC COVID Data Tracker](https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html).

No time series is published for this new version of the data. We therefore started collecting on 13 May 2020 the cumulative total of viral tests reported, which is updated daily.

The CDC makes it clear that ""data are provisional and subject to change. The data presented are aggregate data reported to CDC from state health departments and territorial jurisdictions and might not represent the most current counts for the most recent 3 days due the time it takes to report testing information. The data may also not include results from all potential testing sites within the jurisdiction (e.g., non-laboratory or point of care test sites) and therefore reflect the majority, but not all, of COVID-19 testing being conducted in the United States. If a state did not report laboratory data for a specific day, or if data reported by states are incomplete, data presented reflect what is reported on the state health department website or laboratory testing data reported to the Department of Health and Human Services.""

The CDC previously published a time series that only covered public health labs and did not include private lab tests, which were occurring in significant numbers. Daily figures were provided since 18 January. This data is still visible on [this page of the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/previous-testing-in-us.html)."

[We received confirmation](https://twitter.com/FedericoGanz/status/1252248930118766593) that the figures refer to tests, and not people. The source notes that ""there are people who have been tested more than once. This explains why the total number of positive tests does not coincide with that of people with positive tests.""

We previously reported testing data from a [dashboard maintained by El Observador](https://observador.cr/covid19-estadisticas/), but on 20 April 2020 we replaced the entire time series based on the reports from the Ministry of Health."
VNM,Vietnam - units unclear,2020-04-29,http://web.archive.org/web/20200429184537/https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/documents/20182/6848000/infographicVN1120.jpg/b42a0731-f951-4e69-9cda-8b38ecb3d9cb,Vietnamese Ministry of Health,,37,261004,2.681,,,10906,0.112,Vietnamese Ministry of Health,https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/,"The source reports this as the 'number of samples tested'. However, based on the context, it is unclear whether this refers to the total number of tests conducted, or number of people who have been tested.","The Vietnamese Ministry of Health update its disease situation statistics page daily with the latest data on confirmed cases, deaths and samples tested. 

It refers to its testing data as 'samples tested', and reports confirmed cases and negative samples separately; 'sample tested' generally matches the sum of confirmed cases and negative samples (though there are occasionally some small discrepancies – we report the sum of positive and negative in this case). This would suggest that 'samples tested' is equivalent to the number of people tested. However, it's unclear whether 'negative samples' includes some instances of resampling for the same person. We therefore cannot say with certainty that these are equivalent.

Using web archives we can reconstruct a daily time-series of total samples by looking at previous versions of the updated website. These daily updates extend back to 2nd March. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that as of 2nd March 1753 samples had been tested."
ZWE,Zimbabwe - tests performed,2020-05-19,https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim/status/1262803418894270470,Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care,The press release reports both the cumulative number of tests to date and number of tests conducted today. These figures are no consistent with one another. We use the cumulative number of reported tests as the ground truth.,13,14175,0.954,1071,0.072,445,0.03,Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care,http://www.mohcc.gov.zw,The number of tests performed.,"The Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care provides daily press releases on its website and Twitter account ([@MoHCCZim](https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim)) that report the cumulative number of tests performed to date. The reported figures include positive, negative, and pending test results. It is not clear how many people have been tested, since the reported figures refer only to the number of tests conducted rather than the number of people tested.

The press release for May 6th 2020 reported that 7,808 PCR and 8,244 ""rapid screening"" tests had been conducted to date. We exclude rapid screening tests from the daily time series that we construct, since we assume that these are antibody tests.

Prior to May 6th 2020, the press releases either: (a) reported a combined cumulative total of PCR and rapid screening tests without providing a breakdown between the two types of tests; or (b) did not clearly specify whether the reported cumulative total was in reference to PCR tests, antibody tests, or both. For this reason, the daily time series we construct begins on May 6th 2020, at which point the press releases began to clearly indicate that the reported cumulative totals only include PCR tests."
